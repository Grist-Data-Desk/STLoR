						Title: 
					</span><span>State Mineral Interests</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>State owned mineral  interests administered by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, mapped to the PLS forty and government lot.  When there is no match to the PLS forty or government lot in the PLS40 layer, a record is then matched to the PLS section layer. These layers merge the DNR Control Point Generated PLS layer (PLS40) with land records stored in the DNR's Land Record System (LRS) in Oracle.  The data are limited to a forty, government lot, or section level representation.  Therefore, any state owned lands that are less than a forty, government lot, or section, are represented by the entire forty, government lot, or section. <br><br>This geodatabase (ownedMInterests.gdb) includes two layers and a table.  The layers include<br>minown - a layer of the closed and finalized mineral interests held by the State, with various landtypes (see LANDTYPE in the Attributes Overview section).  There are also fields that contain additional information from research done by the attorneys in MNDNR, Division of Lands and Minerals, in areas that have been considered for mineral lease sales or where there was research done to identify severed mineral interests.<br>SurfMin - a layer that combines all of the closed or finalized surface interests with all of the closed or finalized mineral interests.  It is possible to use this layer to identify spatial units that have either a surface interest or a mineral interest or have both a surface interest and a mineral interest. <br>A related table is mOWNnomats - a list of records that do not match to the PLS forty/glot layer nor to the PLS section layer.  Generally, no match records result from a typographical error in the geocode, in this case the COUN, TOWN, RDIR, and/or RANG fields, or from situations where there is no PLS (e.g., several islands in Lake Superior were never surveyed and therefore have no valid PLS geocode), but an "approximate" geocode was used in the land records.  This table contains a handful of attributes  to help identify these no match records. <br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>To provide Minnesota DNR resource managers and land records specialists access to DNR land records, specifically ownership of mineral interests in GIS format.  For any user of this layer, keep in mind that a layer of mineral ownership is dynamic, not static, and is changed as title research is done by attorneys.  Therefore, records can be added or deleted, or they can be modified in other ways.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

						Currentness Reference: 
					</span><span>Time Period of Content date indicates the date which the user can be confident of accuracy and completeness of the dataset. Land record information is current as of 11/2015 (at the time of this writing).  Updates occur weekly, for all of the State Mineral Interests layers.  The control point generated PLS layer (often referred to as PLS40) was created during the 1990s, with the information based on the General Land Office (GLO) plats and field notes, ranging from the mid-1800s to 1998.  Since that time, additional GLO plats have been used to modify the PLS40 layer to incorporate more recent surveys, especially island surveys, and to make corrections to the PLS40 layer.  To better map the state ownership, a version of PLS40 was modified to include several non-BLM (Bureau of Land Management) surveys.  Note that during processing, any land record that does not match to the PLS forty or government lot is then matched to the PLS section to include as many of the land records as possible in this layer.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>Not specifically assessed</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>The original PLS40 layer was built as separate townships, or parts of townships, coverages in Arc/INFO (from ESRI) during the 1990s.  Due to the manner in which the original surveys were drawn as GLO plats based on the GLO field notes, interpretation errors reading the GLO plats, and Arc/INFO processing methods used, there are gaps and overlaps in the PLS40 layer.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>Only those PLS forties, government lots, or sections in which the State holds an interest are included in these layers.  Note that less than 1% of the Land Records currently do not have some type of polygon match in the PLS40 layer.  In some instances, the no match land records represent islands that were never surveyed and were therefore not included in the GLO plats and field notes.  In other cases, it may be that the geocode for a land record does not match a geocode in the PLS40 layer (e.g., the land record lists a forty description, but the parcel is really in a government lot).  When a geocode of a land record does not match to the PLS40 layer, another match is done to the PLS section layer to include the land record, in some way, in this set of layers.  Refer to the table mOWNnomats for those records that did not match to the forty/glot or to the section.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>Variable.  At its least accurate, the data are based upon points from manual digitizing of PLS section corners from 1:24000 scale, paper, USGS quadrangles (comprising about 90% of the points used to build the PLS40 layer).  At its most accurate, the data is based upon points collected using GPS units operating at a sub-meter level of accuracy.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
								Vertical Positional Accuracy:
							</span><span>Not applicable</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Lineage:
					</span><span>The PLS40 layer was built in the 1990s with Arc/INFO from ESRI, using points digitized from 1:24000 USGS paper quads and some surveyed points.  Cadastral Measurement Management (CMM) software from the Bureau of Land Management was used to combine the point data with bearings and distances captured from the GLO plats and Survey notes to subdivide sections into their aliquot parts, such as a forty or government lot.  In Arc/INFO, the PLS layer was built township by township and later combined into county coverages.  Meander lines were added to the township coverages using the bearings and distances from the original survey notes with Arc/COGO.  After converting the coverages to shapefiles, the county layers were merged into one, statewide-layer, with no error checking for gaps or overlaps of polygon features.</span></div><br><h2 class="unused"><a name="Spatial_Data_Organization_Information"></a>

					Section 5: Attributes
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Overview:
					</span><span>Attributes for the minown (State mineral interests) layer:<br>SU_ID - the unique ID for a LRS spatial unit (aka property)<br>SU_SUID - the non-unique ID of a LRS spatial unit that is a character field type.  In the Land Record System (LRS), spatial units are versioned each time a spatial unit is updated or whenever another type of transaction (such as a lease out) has included it, so the SU_ID changes while the SU_SUID remains the same.  <br>SU_SUIDNUM - the SU_SUID of a spatial unit as a number, so that users can compare the IDs of the new Land Record System data with the GSEQKY of the previous Land Record System<br><br>DNRREGION - the name of the DNR region (currently, Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southern)<br>COUNTYNAME - name of one of Minnesota's counties<br><br>COUN - county identified using a 2-digit number from 1 to 87<br>TOWN - PLS township number, where the township is always N(orth).  The township numbers range from 26-71 in the 4th Principal Meridian and from 101-168 in the 5th Principal Meridian.<br>RDIR - range direction identifier, and 1/2-township and 1/2-range identifiers (where 0 = W(est), 1 = E(ast), and 2 = half-township (T58-1/2N R17W) or half-range (T159N R42-1/2W or T160N R42-1/2W), where these half-township and half-range records are all range W(est)).<br>RANG - PLS range number.  The range numbers range from 1-32W and 1-7E in the 4th Principal Meridian and from 3-51W in the 5th Principal Meridian.<br>SECT - PLS section number or tract number.  BLM assigns a tract number to a parcel of land that lies in more than one section in a township or that cannot be identified as being part of a particular section.  The numbering of tracts in a township start with 37 to avoid confusion with section numbers.  Refer to the Glossary found under the BLM General Land Office Records website for more information about tracts.<br>FORT - 2-digit code to identify the PLS forty (gives an approximate location in the section if there is a government lot).  Refer to the FORTDESC field for a text description of these codes.<br>GLOT - PLS lot number (often referred to as government lot). Land Records with a GLOT = 99 indicates a meandered water body. (GLOT = 99 was used in combination with FORT = 0 to identify meandered water bodies in the PLS40 layer.)<br>GM_CH - a 13- or 14-character string that represents the PLS to the government lot.  This field is used to match to PLS40.  The format of this field is as follows:  CCTTTDRRSSFFGG, where CC is COUN, TTT is TOWN, D is RDIR, RR is RANG, SS is SECT, FF is FORT or '00' (see following note), and GG is GLOT.  Note:  if the GLOT is greater than 0, such as government lot 1, the FF part of GM_CH is set to 00.<br>GS_CH - a 9- or 10-character string that represents the PLS to the section.  This field is used to match to PLS - section level.  The format of this field is as follows:  CCTTTDRRSS, where CC is COUN, TTT is TOWN, D is RDIR, RR is RANG, and SS is SECT.<br>FORTDESC - the PLS forty (aka aliquot part) description using text.  A 4-character string, such as NWNE, should be read as the Northwest 1/4 of the Northeast 1/4.   For extra tall and wide townships, additional government lots are added to sections and the FORTDESC field will be similar to 'Third government lot West of SWSW.' <br><br>PLSMATCH - specifies if the land record matches to the PLS forty/government lot or to the PLS section.  That is, in most cases, the land record matches to the PLS forty or government lot (forty/glot-level) layer.  The mismatches from this check are then matched against the PLS section (section-level) layer so that a user knows that there is a land record somewhere in the section, but the exact location is unknown or there may be an error in some element of the geocode creating a no-match between the land record and PLS40.  Note:  some land records, not including SECT > 36 (i.e., the PLS tract numbers) are only section-level records and can be identified by FORT = 0 and GLOT = 0 and only match to the section-level.  Because tracts are mapped as part of PLS40, these records are flagged as matching to the forty/glot-level.<br><br>SU_ACRES - the number of acres that have a State-owned mineral interest listed for the specific PLS forty, government lot, or section.<br>SU_PCTFORTY - the number of State-owned acres as a percentage of the total area of the PLS forty, government lot, or, rarely, section<br><br>UINT_NUMERATOR - the numerator of the undivided mineral interest in the PLS forty or government lot<br>UINT_DENOMINATOR - the denominator of the undivided mineral interest in the PLS forty or government lot<br><br>INT_TYPE - the type of State-owned interest - Fee Mineral<br>INT_STATUS - the interest status, in most cases Finalized (i.e., the active interest).  Because management of the property can begin after an acquisition has been closed, this layer includes Closed interests.  However, since Closed interests have not gone through the finalization steps of the acquisition, the data may be incomplete or incorrect.<br><br>LANDTYPE - the land type of the mineral interest (including several types of School Trust and University Trust, Acquired, ConCon, Volstead, Tax Forfeited, Other, Rural Credit, or Severed Minerals).  In most cases, ' ' (i.e., blank) is used for the Land Type where the transaction has closed, but has not yet been finalized, and indicates that the records are missing the Land Type.  The specific codes and descriptions follow:<br>A - Acquired<br>C - Consolidated Conservation Area (aka ConCon)<br>M - Severed Minerals<br>O - Other: Non-State<br>R - Rural Credit<br>T - Tax Forfeited<br>V - Volstead<br>1 - Trust Fund: School (School trust)<br>2 - Trust Fund: Indemnity School (School trust)<br>3 - Trust Fund: Swamp (School trust)<br>4 - Trust Fund: Internal Improvement (School trust)<br>5 - Trust Fund: University<br>6 - Trust Fund: Transferred University<br>7 - Trust Fund: Transferred School (School trust)<br>8 - Trust Fund: Agricultural College<br>9 - Trust Fund: Public Building<br><br>MEANSACQ - the means of acquisition of the mineral interest.  The specific codes and descriptions follow:<br>B - County Board Resolution<br>C - Condemnation<br>D - Rural Credit<br>E - Exchange<br>F - Forfeited: General property tax<br>G - Gift<br>O- Other<br>P - Purchase<br>R - Reversion<br>S - State: Transfer<br>U - US: Congressional Grant, Patent, Deed, Etc.<br>1 - Forfeited: Severed Minerals<br>2 - Forfeited: Non-registered severed minerals<br>3 - Non-registered severed minerals<br>4 - Gift: Severed minerals<br><br>LANDTYPECODE - a 1-character code for the land type<br>MEANSACQCODE - a 1-character code for the means of acquisition<br><br>MOWNSTATUS - the mineral interest status, including <br>Y - Yes<br>N - No<br>U - Uncertain <br>MOWNSTATUSCODE - 1-character code for the mineral interest status<br><br>DATA_DOWNLOADDATE - the date the data was downloaded from the Land Record System<br><br>The following attributes contain data when the records have been considered in a metallic mineral lease sale and have been researched by LAM attorneys:<br>OMITTYPES - a reason or reasons that the record should be omitted from a metallic mineral lease sale<br>PRINTACRESFLAG - a flag to indicate if the acres associated with this record should be included in the Mining Unit Book for the metallic mineral lease sale.  This flag is generally used when there are multiple records, such as multiple Severed Mineral records, of which the acres from only one is included in the lease sale.  Records flagged as Yes or ' ' in the data are included.<br><br>LANDCLASS - identifies the means by which the lands and mineral rights were obtained by the State and is used to direct income to the correct fund.  The categories (with definitions from the introduction to a Mining Unit Book for a metallic mineral lease sale, but not including the description of how the revenues are distributed based on the LANDCLASS) include<br>CCA - Consolidated Conservation Area Lands<br>DOT - Lands acquired by the Department of Transportation<br>ESCHEAT - Lands escheated to the state due to the absence of any legal heir<br>FOREST - Lands acquired by MNDNR, Division of Forestry for state forest purposes<br>FORF MINS - Forfeited Severed Minerals<br>GAME/FISH - Game and Fish Fund Lands acquired by purchase for game and fish purposes and managed by the MNDNR, Division of Fish and Wildlife<br>GEN GIFT - Lands and mineral rights granted to the state through gift with no specific fund designated for distribution of any income<br>GENERAL - General Fund.  Tax forfeited lands acquired free from the trust in favor of taxing districts pursuant to resolution of a county board.<br>LUP - Land Utilization Project Lands purchased by the U.S. Government from private individuals and subsequently deeded to the State of Minnesota.<br>NREG MINS - Nonregistered Severed Minerals.  Severed mineral interests where the owner has failed to file a verified statement required by a Minnesota Statute before dates specified in another Minnesota Statute.<br>R CREDIT - Lands acquired by the state through mortgage foreclosure proceedings under the Rural Credit laws.<br>SCHOOL - School, swamp, and indemnity school lands that were granted to the state from the federal government.  The state represents it owns the minerals for these lands acquired from the federal government.<br>SCHOOL* - School, swamp, and indemnity school lands that were acquired through exchange involving trust fund lands.  The state does not guarantee to own the minerals acquired in this way.<br>SCHOOL@ - School, swamp, and indemnity school lands that were acquired through settlement of a court action involving trust fund lands.  The state does not guarantee to own the minerals acquired in this way.<br>TAX LANDS - Tax Forfeited Lands.  Lands forfeited to the state for nonpayment of general real estate taxes.<br>TAX MINS - Tax Forfeited Minerals.  Severed mineral interests that have forfeited to the state for nonpayment of severed mineral interests taxes.<br>UNIV - University lands that were patented to the state from the federal government.  The state represents that it owns the minerals for these lands acquired from the federal government.<br>UNIV* - University lands that were acquired through exchange involving these lands.  The state does not guarantee to own the minerals acquired in this way.<br>VOLSTEAD - Volstead Lands.  Federal Public Domain Lands that had been subject to Volstead liens for drainage projects and that have subsequently been purchased by the State of Minnesota.  The state represents that it owns the minerals acquired in this way.<br>VOLSTEAD* - Volstead Lands acquired by exchange.

No indicates that the Surface is not included with the mineral rights.  It is possible that the state owns the surface through an acquisition different from the mineral rights acquisition. <br>LAST_OFFERED - the last time the record was offered in a mineral lease sale.  For example, F07 indicates Fall 2007,  83 and x83 indicates lease sales in 1983.<br>LAST_PROCESSED - a 3-character field indicating the last time the record was processed for a mineral lease sale.  For example, F12 indicates Fall 2012,  83 indicates 1983.  A large number of records are researched, but only some of them are offered at a mineral lease sale.<br>LAST_PROCESSED_YEAR - the year in which the record was last processed for a mineral lease sale<br><br>The SurfMin layer contains these same attributes as the minown layer:  SU_ID, SU_SUID, SU_SUIDNUM, DNRREGION, COUNTYNAME, COUN, TOWN, RDIR, RANG, SECT, FORT, GLOT, PLSMATCH, and DATA_DOWNLOADDATE.

						Detailed Citation:
					</span><span>The topic of State owned mineral interests is very complex - use the attribute table to help with these issues.  Some terms and concepts may help to clarify the issues.  <br>(1) State owned mineral interests - mineral interests that are owned by the State of Minnesota.  Official ownership records are located in each county in the County Recorder's Office.  The DNR land records are not the official records, but may be considered secondary sources of mineral ownership information and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of these interests.  <br>A severed mineral interest indicates that the ownership of the mineral interest has been separated (or severed) from the ownership of the surface interest.<br>(2) Interest Acquired - the real property interest that the State owns, in this case Fee Minerals.  <br>(3) Administrator - the administrator of State owned mineral interests is the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR), Division of Lands and Minerals.<br>(4) Land Type - land type is a legal and financial designation determining accountability and destination of revenues.  Land types (LANDTYPE field in the data) include several types of School and University Trust, ConCon (Consolidated Conservation Area lands), Acquired, Volstead, Tax Forfeited, Severed Minerals, Rural Credit.<br>(5) Means of acquisition - use the means of acquisition (MEANSACQ field in the data) in conjunction with the land type to identify how the State acquired the mineral interest. <br>(6) Acreage - the acreage for a land record is based on the acreage for the public land survey GLO plat, a registered resurvey, acreage reported by the county auditor, or acreage listed on the deed to the property.  The legally valid acreage is determined by deed and/or tax assessor/registered survey.  For most purposes, it is a matter of record, rather than a matter of measurement.  <br>(7) Subdivided parcels - since the land records are only mapped to the PLS forty, government lot, or in a few cases, the section, the SU_PCTFORTY field can be used to identify full-PLS ownership versus sub-PLS ownership. (For example, if SU_PCTFORTY = 100, 100% of the forty/government lot is state-owned.  If SU_PCTFORTY = 25, 25% of the forty/government lot is state-owned, according to the land record.  When the SU_PCTFORTY is less than 100%, there can be other state-owned records in the same forty/government lot.)  <br>(8) Undivided interests - an undivided interest occurs when ownership in a parcel is distributed among more than one owner and the parcel is not physically subdivided.  In these cases, the ownership is equally shared throughout the entire acreage of the parcel.  When UINT_NUMERATOR <> UINT_DENOMINATOR, the record is an undivided interest.<br>(9) Meander lines - a meander line is not the ownership boundary for a water-oriented government lot.  The actual ownership of the land is determined, in most cases, by the ordinary high water mark.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
