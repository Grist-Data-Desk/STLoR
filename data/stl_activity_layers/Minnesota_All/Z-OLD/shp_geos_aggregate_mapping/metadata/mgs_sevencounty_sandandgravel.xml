      <abstract>The original data of sand and gravel aggregate sources was sourced from the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS) for the M-102 project, Primary Sources of Construction Aggregate in the Twin Cities Seven-County Metropolitan Area. The dataset presented here was reformatted by the MN DNR in order to distribute it on an online map server of Aggregate Resources data. The original data file is called 'agsg99_polygon'. The datafile included codes rather than descriptions. The DNR reformatted the data by adding in descriptions for each code for easier reading and comprehension. Please consult the orignial MGS data, maps, and metadata at: http://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/57004

According to the MGS, information that was used to map sand and gravel deposits used various criteria. Several operators and consultants in the aggregate industry, staff of the Materials Division of the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Division of Minerals of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources helped to establish the criteria. Deposits are classified by percentage of material retained on the number 4 sieve (4.76-millimeter pore space), sand and gravel thickness, thickness of overlying deposits, location of the water table, and relative amounts of subsurface information available 

Data was divided into primary sources, potential secondary sources, and gravel pits. It was subdivied by sieve data, thickness of sand and gravel deposit, thickness of overlying sediments, position of water table, and finaly data reliability. This is listed in table 2 of the M-102 map plates. </abstract>
      <purpose>To summarize the sand and gravel resource potential digitized by the MGS for the 7-county metropolitan area to assist in the goal of Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94.

The sand and gravel resouce potential spatial database is an interpretative data product intended to be used for planning purposes. For example, a community may want to differentiate and protect resources by their quality; they may want to separate resource extraction from other uses to minimize land-use conflict; or they may want to reduce haulage cost by identifying sources in proximity to a project because aggregate is a high bulk, low price commodity and transportation costs can significantly affect price.

About Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94 and the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program:
The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: Identify and classify aggregate resources out side of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.

According to the MGS Map M-102, Sand and gravel deposits were mapped and named as simple land forms and divided into different classifications using various criteria. Several operators and consultants in the aggregate industry, staff of the Materials Division of the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Division of Minerals of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources helped to establish the criteria. Deposits are classified by percentage of material retained on the number 4 sieve (4.76-millimeter pore space), sand and gravel thickness, thickness of overlying deposits, location of the water table, and relative amounts of subsurface information available.</procdesc>
