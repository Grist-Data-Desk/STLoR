The attribute data available varies as a result of the varied years of completion and changes in databases structure and verbiage over time. The past project GIS data has been loaded into the current file geodatabase used by the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program. Therefore the data from the most recent completed counties (Kandiyohi, Aitkin, Stearns, Kanabec, Olmsted) have the most complete attribute table, while the earlier mapped counties (Sherburne, Wright, Isanti) have limited attribute data. Digital sand and gravel resource potential has been delineated for the Sherburne County Project completed in 1987 and continues today. 
This spatial dataset can consist of information about the geology, geological characteristics, and sand and gravel potential for 21 counties in Minnesota. Recent completed maps include data fields related to the surficial geology of the map unit, including a major sediment, minor sediment, landform, surficial geology description, probability (unit certainty), depositional variability, and lobe provenance. Five fields relate to sand and gravel characteristics, including sand and gravel probability, quality, texture, overburden thickness, and sand and gravel thickness. These characteristics were used to calculate the aggregate potential of the map unit for sand and gravel.</abstract><purpose>To summarize the sand and gravel resource potential digitized in Minnesota from a compilation of GIS aggregate resources (sand and gravel, crushed stone) reconnaissance scale data spanning twenty county projects completed over a number of years (1987-present). 

The purpose of this project and data is to identify and classify potential construction-aggregate resources in Aitkin County, Minnesota. This mapping is being done in accordance with the 1984, Minnesota Statue 84.94, Aggregate Planning and Protection law directing the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), in cooperation with the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS), and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) to identify and classify potential aggregate resources.

The Sand and Gravel Potential spatial database is an interpretative data product intended to be used for planning purposes. For example, a community may want to differentiate and protect resources by their quality; they may want to separate resource extraction from other uses to minimize land-use conflict; or they may want to reduce haulage cost by identifying sources in proximity to a project because aggregate is a high bulk, low price commodity and transportation costs can significantly affect price.

The most up-to-date topographic, soil, and test-hole data were used in the construction of this data at the time of its creation. New data were also gathered during the mapping effort, at a scale appropriate for the final map scale of 1:50,000.
However this is a regional reconaissance-scale map and it is still necessary to conduct a detailed investigation to verify the information before investing in a deposit or making site-specific decisions. Factors that were not included in the preparation of this map include ownership, zoning, environmental considerations and protection or easement status.

About the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program:
The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: Identify and classify aggregate resources out side of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.

Generally speaking, the sand and gravel resource potential data was compiled digitally using GIS software available at the time of map completion (ex. ArcInfo Workstation, ArcView, ArcGIS) between 1987 to present. Sand and gravel resource potential data was digitized based on the most current GIS data sources available at the time. These can include, but are not limited to: digital elevation models (DEM); field observations; gravel pit data; test holes; sample test data; air-photo interpretations; U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 topographic maps; other geologic maps; and digital soil information from National Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS) soil survey (SSURGO). </procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><eainfo><detailed><enttyp><enttypl>Fields and Attributes</enttypl></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>PitComp_ID</attrlabl><attrdef>A Unique ID for each record (ex.
