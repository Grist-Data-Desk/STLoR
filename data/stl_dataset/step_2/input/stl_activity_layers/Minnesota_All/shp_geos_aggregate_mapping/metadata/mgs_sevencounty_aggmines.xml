      <abstract>The original data of active and inactive sand and gravel pits and/or quarries were sourced from the Minnesota Geological Survey's (MGS) M-102 project, Primary Sources of Construction Aggregate in the Twin Cities Seven-County Metropolitan Area. The dataset presented is a compilation of two shapefiles (agptbr_point.shp &amp; agptsg_point.shp) from the M-102 project and was reformatted by the MN DNR in order to distribute it on an online map server of Aggregate Resources data. The original data files are called 'agptbr_point.shp &amp; agptsg_point.shp'. These datafiles included codes rather than descriptions. The DNR reformatted the data by adding in descriptions for each code for easier reading and comprehension. Please consult the orignial MGS data, maps, and metadata at: http://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/57004

</abstract>
      <purpose>To summarize the sand and gravel resource potential digitized by the MGS for the 7-county metropolitan area to assist in the goal of Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94.

The compiled active and inactive sand and gravel pits and quarries spatial database is an interpretative data product intended to be used for planning purposes. For example, a community may want to differentiate and protect resources by their quality; they may want to separate resource extraction from other uses to minimize land-use conflict; or they may want to reduce haulage cost by identifying sources in proximity to a project because aggregate is a high bulk, low price commodity and transportation costs can significantly affect price.

About Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94 and the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program:
The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: Identify and classify aggregate resources out side of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.
