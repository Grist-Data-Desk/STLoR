						Title: 
					</span><span>Aggregate Resource Mapping Program - Compilation of Gravel Pits, Quarries, and Prospects</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This spatial dataset of pits, quarries, and prospects is based on a compilation of GIS aggregate resources (sand and gravel, crushed stone) reconnaissance scale data spanning twenty county projects completed over a number of years (1987-present) by the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP). The attribute data available varies as a result of the varied years of completion and changes in databases structure and verbiage over time. The past project GIS data has been loaded into the current file geodatabase used by the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program. Therefore the data from the most recent completed counties (Kandiyohi, Aitkin, Stearns, Kanabec, Olmsted) have the most complete attribute table, while the earlier mapped counties (Sherburne, Wright, Isanti) have limited attribute data.  
<br>
<br>This dataset includes information gathered in the field by Aggregate Mapping Resource Program geologists since 1987.  It includes 6,393 aggregate resource or prospective sites in Minnesota. There are pits and quarries that are currently being mined or have been mined. Several sources of information identify pit locations: topographic maps, aerial photographs, soil surveys, Mn/DOT (Aggregate Source Information System) ASIS files, LiDAR topographic data, fieldwork, gravel operators, and other miscellaneous sources. Pits range in size from less than 1 acre to greater than 50 acres and may be active, inactive, or reclaimed. The aggregate quality of the pit varies.<br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>To display a compilation of current (at the time of mapping) and historic mining pit (gravel, sand, borrow, quarry) locations sourced from the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program completed projects. 
<br>
<br>About the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program:
<br>The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: Identify and classify aggregate resources out side of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.

<br>
<br>Generally speaking, these data points were captured from several different digital GIS data sources at the time of mapping, including USGS 1:24000 quadrangles, 1:12000 USGS DOQs (from 1991), Farm Service Agency (FSA) color air photos (from 2003-04, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2019), Natural Resource Conservation Service Soil Survey point data, and the ASIS (Aggregate Source Information System) dataset from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. 
<br>
<br>For counties completed after 2006 the points were edited in the field with a GPS (+/- 3 Meters), tablet PC, and ArcGIS Desktop. For counties completed prior to 2006 points were penciled in on printed USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle maps and later digitized on screen using GIS software.</span></div><br><h2 class="unused"><a name="Spatial_Data_Organization_Information"></a>

						Overview:
					</span><span>This dataset consists of aggregate resource pit, quarry, or prospect  information such as; location, type, source, material, relative size, material thickness and overburden, depth to water table, dominant texture, lithology, status, and geologist comments. Much of this information is not available for Counties completed prior to 2000. After 2005 the attribute data stays pretty consistent.
<br>
<br>An example attribute table with descriptions for field observations is provided here from the Kanabec County Aggregate Map:

If the location did intersect a gravel pit, the locations were interpreted off of existing gravel pit sheets to relocate the mines to as specified on the sheet. This was ranked highest because of associated quality and texture data. Some locations were modified to better correlate to present gravel pit boundaries and on top of USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map symbols.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Topographic Map</td><td>These gravel pits are located from USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles. This was ranked second highest because of the widespread use of the maps. Where field checked, some of these pit types were changed from gravel to borrow or sand pits to reflect the material excavated.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Field Work</td><td>These pits were located while in the field. These pits were ranked third highest due to the fact they were directly observed for quality, texture, and spatial accuracy.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Soil Survey</td><td>The records for these pits are from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) Aitkin County. The dataset was downloaded in June 2010. These pits were ranked fourth highest.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Air Photo</td><td>Gravel mines were also located and some attributes were interpreted with air photography.
