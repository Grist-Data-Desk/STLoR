This data was completed for a compilation of GIS aggregate resources (sand and gravel, crushed stone) reconnaissance scale data spanning twenty-seven county projects completed over a number of years (1987-present) by the DNR's Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) and also the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS). </abstract><purpose>To display the status of completed, in-progress, and requested Aggregate Resource Mappnig Program projects including links to project webpages and data downloads. 

About the Aggregate Resource Mapping Program:
The Aggregate Resource Mapping Program (ARMP) began in 1984 when the Minnesota Legislature passed a law (Minnnesota Statutes, section 84.94) to: Identify and classify aggregate resources out side of the Twin Cities metropolitan area; Give aggregate resource information to local units of government and others for making comprehensive land-use and zoning plans; Introduce aggregate resource protection; and Promote orderly and environmentally sound development of the resource.
